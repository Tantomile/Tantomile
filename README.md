### Welcome to my profile!

i sometimes write code and stuff. 

i'm not entirely sure how it says i have 600,000 lines of code changed lol

right now i'm primarly focusing on creating a discord bot for use in countervandalism on wikipedia. 

I know HTML, Java, JavaScript, & Swift, with varying levels of fluency depending on how tired i am :)
